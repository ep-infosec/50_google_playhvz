/**
 *  Custom navigator class that reuses a fragment if it's already created instead of creating a new
 *  one. Without this class (aka using the default FragmentNavigator) unexpected things happen.
 *
 *  Namely, on rotation or on activity recreation when the app is resumed:
 *   1. The fragment that was shown calls all it's lifecycle methods
 *   2. That old fragment is destroyed
 *   3. A new fragment is created.
 *   That's bad behavior for us because we're counting on observers only being set up once. When
 *   onCreate() or onCreateView() is called twice we skip creating the firebase observers the second
 *   time because we see that we're already observing the data after the first call... only thing is
 *   the first fragment is destroyed, so effectively we aren't actually listening.
 *
 *   This class checks the fragment we're trying to navigate to. If it matches the fragment we're
 *   already showing then we just reuse that fragment instance. This ensures that onCreate() etc
 *   will only be called once and every fragment can only have one instance on the stack.
 *
 *   During development you can easily test/recreate issues by using the Android Developer setting
 *   for "Don't keep activities".
