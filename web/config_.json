Welcome to config_.json!
This is a template file which you can use to create the REAL config.json.
See which of the below cases apply to you and use the appropriate config.

To have a client which talks to the prod backend and the prod firebase,
have a config.json which only contains this:

{
	"backendUrl": "https://humansvszombies-24348.appspot.com/",
	"firebaseConfig": {
		"apiKey": "AIzaSyCyNJ8cgkeiWNOO9axMDx1BLXSgf69I2RM",
		"authDomain": "trogdors-29fa4.firebaseapp.com",
		"databaseURL": "https://trogdors-29fa4.firebaseio.com",
		"projectId": "trogdors-29fa4",
		"storageBucket": "trogdors-29fa4.appspot.com",
		"messagingSenderId": "625580091272"
	},
	"fakeUserIds": {
		"zella": "3wSU8h9ONrenQEGWAHUdfyi0ifl1",
		"reggie": "9kmCUI3VBpb8NhbO8yeYrv9jFk02",
		"minny": "XmAFbKI4EhORFG5nGJIk6rgcPxI3",
		"drake": "V1Qzso4PZLR06II3cDzQpYhQkv13",
		"zeke": "dXQVCY2folR1H5YOIBHNrgcVsot2",
		"moldavi": "jAgZVgNVgHcbKDhdeYMzAUzaP4L2",
		"jack": "Uvpnj4GU3WPYoPAOkI6ZnRau3Vr1",
		"deckerd": "54jqFxbj0VYKNcvTYEFWgd1tnI12"
	}
}

To have a client which talks to a local backend and the prod firebase,
have a config.json which only contains this:

{
	"backendUrl": "http://localhost:8080/",
	"firebaseConfig": {
		"apiKey": "AIzaSyCyNJ8cgkeiWNOO9axMDx1BLXSgf69I2RM",
		"authDomain": "trogdors-29fa4.firebaseapp.com",
		"databaseURL": "https://trogdors-29fa4.firebaseio.com",
		"projectId": "trogdors-29fa4",
		"storageBucket": "trogdors-29fa4.appspot.com",
		"messagingSenderId": "625580091272"
	},
	"fakeUserIds": {
		"zella": "3wSU8h9ONrenQEGWAHUdfyi0ifl1",
		"reggie": "9kmCUI3VBpb8NhbO8yeYrv9jFk02",
		"minny": "XmAFbKI4EhORFG5nGJIk6rgcPxI3",
		"drake": "V1Qzso4PZLR06II3cDzQpYhQkv13",
		"zeke": "dXQVCY2folR1H5YOIBHNrgcVsot2",
		"moldavi": "jAgZVgNVgHcbKDhdeYMzAUzaP4L2",
		"jack": "Uvpnj4GU3WPYoPAOkI6ZnRau3Vr1",
		"deckerd": "54jqFxbj0VYKNcvTYEFWgd1tnI12"
	}
}

To have a client which talks to a local backend and your own development firebase,
have a config.json which looks like this, but with values from your own firebase
instance (see the README for how to make your own firebase instance).

{
	"backendUrl": "http://localhost:8080/",
	"firebaseConfig": {
		"apiKey": (something),
		"authDomain": (something),
		"databaseURL": (something),
		"projectId": (something),
		"storageBucket": (something),
		"messagingSenderId": (something)
	},
	"fakeUserIds": {
		"zella": (something),
		"reggie": (something),
		"minny": (something),
		"drake": (something),
		"zeke": (something),
		"moldavi": (something),
		"jack": (something),
		"deckerd": (something)
	}
}

There's more to getting a local client, local backend, and development firebase
instance to work, see the README.
